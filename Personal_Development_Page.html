		<p> From the book of Twelve pillars, Chapter 4 has taught me the importance of manifesting our 
			goals not just by thinking about them but writing them down. There is an intrinsic value when goals are clearly written and defined. 
			I have also came to an understanding that the level of motivation and enthusiasm that we have towards life can be 
			impacted negatively by the the unrealistic time span we give ourselves to achieve these goals and sometimes the 
			unrealistic goals we set for ourselves at that current time.</p> 
			
			<p> To achieve our goals, we must clearly set realistic ones,
			and clearly understand the requirements and time it will take to achieve them. This will allow us a realistic 
			and fair chance to experience and understand both the shortcomings and achievements in pursuing these goals, with 
			the intention of using these experiences to better ourselves. </p>
			
			<p> According to Twelve Pillars, there are two major criterions of setting goals. The first one is that goals must be time-specific in accordance 
			with the effort and planning it will take to achieve these goals. The second one is goals should be set 
			focusing less on the outcome but more on how the goal will improve you as a person when accomplished. 
			So going forward, when I’m using the goal setting theory, I’ll ensure that my goals are placed in categories of short, medium and long-term 
			while considering the level of impact accomplishing these goals will have on me in adding value to my sense of being.</p>
			
			<p> In pursing our goals, we find that our daily routines do not naturally align with our aspirations. 
			Twelve Pillars quoted to bridge this gap discipline and dedication is vital in overcoming these challenges. 
			The first and main step in overcoming this misalignment is to recognize the gap between where we are and where we want to be. 
			Our goals, to be successful will often require us to understand where we are in life, 
			step out of our comfort zones, and adopt new habits and routines to reach our desired destination. This chapter has taught me to improve our lives, 
			we must be conscious of our daily actions ensuring that they align with the goals we set for ourselves. </p>
			
		<p> 
			Overall, Chapters 4-7 from twelve Pillars has taught me the conscious effort to restructure our lives and align our goals with our daily 
			routines will require great discipline and dedication.
			The amount of value one adds to their life is not only determined by our individual actions but also by our external environment. 
			The people we surround ourselves and foster relationships with play a crucial role in how we think about life and approach its challenges.  
			To grow in success or as a person, will require us to surround ourselves with people of different personalities, success and sometimes interest. 
			These chapters have reinforced the great impact that the people I surround and foster relationships with have on my attitude towards life
			and living a fulfilled life. This reinforcer has made me realise that nothing is wrong with leaving friends 
			and important people behind who have different aspirations. Being socially diverse will 
			now be a valuable characteristic that I will spend more time on to make new friends and 
			surround myself with people who will influence me to continue growing and think differently.
