			<i><h1 style = "color :red" > 1.) Strongest Trait</h1></i>
			
			<p style = "color:White; font-size:20px;" > My strongest trait, persistence, plays a key role in my academic life. When faced with challenging subjects or tough assignments,
			I stick with them until I understand the material or complete the work. For example, if I struggle with complex networking concepts, 
			I continously review and seek additional resources until I grasp them. 
			</p> </big>
			
			<p style = "color:White; font-size: 20px;"> In addition, because of my persisistence I am able to contribute greatly in group assignments by pushing through set backs of group dynamics 
			and motivate my peers to keep pushing forward. Overall, having great Persisitence as a trait helps me to meet deadlines and maintain 
			satisfying grades even in difficult courses.

				<p 	Style = "font-size: 20px; color: white;" > Cristiano Ronaldo, is a widely know portugese soccer player. He is an inspiration because of his
				incredible ambition and dedication to his craft. At 38 years old, he's still competing at the highest 
				level of football as well as playing in major competitions such as the UEFA Euro 2024, a testmenet to 
				his relentless work ethic and desire to stay on top of his game. 
				</p>
			
				<p Style = "font-size: 20px; color:white;" > Ronaldo's ability to adapt, push himself beyond limits and maintain peak physical condition is truly inspiring
				. His determination to succeed motivates me to be persistent as well as keep focusing on my academic and 
				personal goals.

		<p Style = "font-size:20px; color:White;" > In this video the portuguese soccer player was escorted off the field due to an injury in a World Finals against france,
			one of the most important games of his life. Despite not being able to play the finals, he moitvated his team and 
			cheered them from the sidelines ulitmately helping his team of inexperienced players to win a major trophy for 
			Portugual. This video is my favourite scene because it showed intense emotion and his leadership qualities and ambitious character despite 
			unfavourable circumstances of him not being able to play and help his country to victory due to sustaining an 
			injury during the match.

			<h1 style = "color :red" > 4.) Personality Test </h1>
			<p 	Style = "font-size: 130%; color: white;" >I was categorized as a guardian according to keirsey Personality test </p>
			<img src = "Assets/Personality_test.png" width = "100%">	
			
			
		<p Style = "font-size:20px; color:White;" > The Keirsey Personality Test offers a broad categorization of individuals into temperaments, and while it can 
		provide useful insights, its general validity is debatable. In particular, the test may not be comprehensive enough to capture the full complexity of human personality. 
		The Guardian category, which focuses on traits like responsibility,loyalty, and structure, aligns well with my personal characteristics, and I 
		found the test to be a valid reflection of my tendencies. However, I recognize that its generalized nature and lack of detailed options may 
		make it less valid for others. People have unique, multifaceted personalities, and a more in-depth approach might be needed to accurately 
		represent everyone. </p>
